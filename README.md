# Project-1

## What the project does
* Reciplanner was created as a tool for people who are too busy to think of healthy meals to eat on a daily/weekly basis and too busy to keep track of their calorie intake.

## Why the project is useful
* This project is useful because it has a clean and simple design and returns excellent recipes from the Spoonacular API when a user searches by recipe name or a desired ingredient. 
* You can save recipes to your profile and then plan your meals for the day using the drag and drop feature. 
* The meal planner section of the profile page calculates your total calories for the day as you drag and drop recipes.

## How users can get started with the project
* Users can search for recipes from the home page, and then they are directed to a sign-in modal when they click on the sign in button on the upper left-hand side of the page or when they click on the individual recipe’s save button.
* Once users are signed in, they can save recipes to their profile page and drag and drop to use the meal planner.

## Where users can get help with the project
* Users can contact us via our GitHub profiles linked in the footer of the project.

## Who maintains and contributes to the project
* Jovan Carty, Evgenia Semez, Steven Mason, and Laura Baughman. 
* Each of their GitHub profiles are linked in the footer of the project.

## Future functionality/goals
* Incorporate an Amazon Fresh link for shopping for ingredients
* Have nearby restaurants or grocery stores or amazon fresh pickup locations show on the google map
* Be able to actually view the recipe (on click, have a modal that shows the recipe)
* Make the meal planner weekly instead of daily
* Be able to save ingredients to a grocery shopping list and have that list sorted by section of the store as well as combine any repeated ingredients
* The app could generate a list of “missing” ingredients for a selected recipe. Say you have a bunch of chicken and onions that you want to use; if you search for these ingredients, the Spoonacular API can show you recipes that have them and generate a list of what’s missing.
